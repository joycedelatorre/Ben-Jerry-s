# Ben-Jerry-s

##### Goal to practice handlebars by rendering images, & html. 

##### By calling the ff routes:

1. / -> this should show the 3 flavors of Ben & Jerry's
2. /totally_baked -> this should only show the flavor Totally Baked
3. /Coffee -> this should only show the flavor Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz
4. /chunky_monkey -> this should only show the flavor Chunky Monkey


Below is an image of desired results.
